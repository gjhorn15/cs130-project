## What Video Game Data Reveals About the Industry: A Data-Driven Story

The video game industry is one of the most influential entertainment sectors in the world, shaping culture, technology, and the way millions of people spend their free time. But behind the flashy graphics and big releases are patterns—hidden in the data—that show what types of games people gravitate toward, how players respond to quality, and how the industry evolves over time.
I wanted to dive deeper into these patterns using the CORGIS Video Games dataset and explore what the numbers say about the state of gaming. What I found paints a revealing picture of both player behavior and industry trends.

## Visualization 1: Which Genres Dominate the Market?

When I started this project, I assumed that action games (like shooters or adventure titles) would dominate the industry. The dataset confirmed this assumption very quickly. After cleaning and splitting the genre data since many games list multiple genres I counted how often each genre appeared. The bar chart above shows that Action, Adventure, and Shooter games far outnumber other genres.

This tells an important story about both game development and consumer demand. Studios tend to invest heavily in genres that are reliable sellers, and players gravitate toward experiences that feel immersive or exciting. But it also exposes a potential weakness in the industry: a lack of diversity. Genres like Puzzle, Strategy, and Education appear far less often, which may reflect fewer opportunities for smaller studios or less experimentation among major publishers.

The numbers reinforce the idea that mainstream gaming continues to be dominated by high-budget, high intensity experiences a trend that shapes everything from marketing budgets to console hardware decisions.

## Visualization 2: Do Better Reviews Actually Improve Sales?

To test whether players tend to buy highly rated games, I created a scatter plot comparing Review Score to Sales. The correlation coefficient turned out to be positive, which means that on average games with higher review scores sell more units.

But the visualization reveals something even more interesting: the relationship is not perfectly linear. There are several games with average review scores but very high sales, and several critically acclaimed titles that didn’t sell as well. This suggests that review scores matter, but they aren’t the only factor. Brand recognition, marketing, platform exclusivity, and franchise history play major roles in shaping outcomes.

Still, the upward trend shouldn’t be ignored. Good games do tend to perform better, and the data supports the idea that players care about quality. If anything, the scatter plot highlights the tug-of-war between artistic quality and commercial success a balance every studio must navigate.

## Visualization 3: How Game Releases Have Changed Over Time

Another pattern I wanted to explore was how the number of games released each year has shifted over time. After converting the release year data into numeric format and removing invalid entries, I plotted the number of games released per year. The result is a clear upward trend, especially through the late 1990s and 2000s.

This aligns with some major changes in the gaming world. The rise of 3D graphics, the explosion of console popularity, and the emergence of PC gaming all drove more studios into the industry. The mid 2000s spike also matches the era when online marketplaces like Steam and Xbox Live Arcade made publishing easier for smaller developers.

However, the graph also shows instability in recent years. This could be due to incomplete data or real world events like the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted development cycles worldwide. Regardless, the visualization helps tell a broader story: gaming is not just growing it is evolving, refining, and adapting.

## What This All Means

Looking at these visualizations together paints a clearer picture of how the video game industry operates:

Studios invest heavily in genres with proven success, which narrows variety and pushes the industry toward blockbusters.

Quality tends to lead to commercial success, though big name franchises often bend this rule.

The industry has grown dramatically, driven by technology and accessibility, but it may also be reaching new challenges that affect output.

As someone who enjoys gaming, I found this analysis both validating and eye opening. It confirmed some of my assumptions, challenged others, and helped me see the industry from a more data focused perspective. Understanding these trends matters not just for gamers but also for developers, analysts, and anyone interested in the future of entertainment.
